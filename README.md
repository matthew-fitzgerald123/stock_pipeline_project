# stock pipeline project
I wanted to create an application that makes use of a CI/CD pipeline. I never used Heroku before for CI/CD so I had to make an 
account as well as also get an API key from Alpha Vantage for live stock prices.

**Process**
1. Created my repository and local project folders. 

2. Installed the appropriate libraries and tools needed like node as well as Heroku CLI (Command Line Tools)

3. Pushed my project repository to the Heroku repo.

**Libraries used:**
Node.js, Express.js, Heroku, Fullstack,

This was very, very quickly done.

The application is accesible at
